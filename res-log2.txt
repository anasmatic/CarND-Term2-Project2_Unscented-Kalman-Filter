code flow is fine
bad rmse, a nose & yawd noises = 30

try noise a = 0 , result bad as fuck
try noise a = 15 , result getting better
try noise a = 7 , result getting better than 15{.08,.10,.56,.64}
try noise a = 15+7 , result worst than 7 {.09,.11,.79,.89}
try noise a = 3 , result even better {.0785,.0957,.5046,.5506}
try noise a = 1.5 , result slightly better {.0693,.0935,.4899,.5083}
try noise a = .75 , result slightly better 
I'll stop here and tune yawd because I left it @ 30
try yawd = .75 , result slightly better {.0628,.0841,.3269,.2267}
try yawd = 7 , result worst than before {.0636,.0889,.3902,.3456}
try yawd = .05 , result now are confusing {.02117,.1949,.5731,.4859}
